### 2. FirstPersonController.cs Implemented
Location: `Assets/Scripts/Player/FirstPersonController.cs`

**Features:**
- ✅ WASD movement with smooth controls
- ✅ Sprint functionality (Hold Shift)
- ✅ Jump mechanics (Space key)
- ✅ Mouse look with vertical clamping (±90°)
- ✅ Gravity and ground detection
- ✅ CharacterController integration
- ✅ Cursor locking for immersive gameplay
- ✅ ESC key to unlock cursor (for testing)
- ✅ Comprehensive XML documentation
- ✅ Public methods for state queries

**Code Quality:**
- Clean, well-documented code
- Follows Unity best practices
- Uses CharacterController (not Rigidbody)
- Separate horizontal/vertical rotation
- Proper component validation

### 3. Configuration Files
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Already configured for Unity
- ✅ `.env.example` - Template for API key configuration
- ✅ `UNITY_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed setup guide

## ⏳ Pending Manual Steps

### Unity Project Creation (Required)
You must manually create the Unity project through Unity Hub:

1. **Open Unity Hub**
2. **Create New Project**:
   - Template: 3D (Built-in Render Pipeline)
   - Name: `LLM_StoryGame`
   - Location: `/Users/manaskandimalla/Desktop/Projects/SeriousProjects/indie-game`

3. **Follow the detailed instructions in**: `UNITY_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Scene Setup (After Unity Project Created)
1. Create MainGame scene
2. Set up Player GameObject with:
   - CharacterController component
   - FirstPersonController script
   - Camera child object
3. Create test environment (ground + obstacles)
4. Test in Play mode

### Git Commit (After Testing)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Task 1: Project setup and first-person controller implementation"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (You Must Do):
1. **Open Unity Hub** and create the project
2. **Follow** `UNITY_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` step-by-step
3. **Test** the controller in Play mode
4. **Commit** changes to Git

### After Task 01 Complete:
- Proceed to **Task 02: LLM Integration Layer**

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `Assets/Scripts/Player/FirstPersonController.cs` - Main controller script
- `UNITY_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `.env.example` - API key template
- `TASK_01_STATUS.md` - This status file

### Folder Structure:
- Complete `Assets/` folder hierarchy created

## 💡 Important Notes

### Why Manual Unity Setup?
Unity projects must be created through Unity Hub or Unity Editor. The project files (ProjectSettings/, Packages/, etc.) are generated by Unity and cannot be created programmatically.

### CharacterController vs Rigidbody
The implementation uses `CharacterController` because:
- Provides precise, game-like movement
- No unwanted physics interference
- Standard for first-person games
- Better performance for player control

### Code Architecture
The controller separates concerns:
- **Body rotation**: Horizontal (left/right)
- **Camera rotation**: Vertical (up/down)
- This prevents gimbal lock and feels natural

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Once Unity project is created, test:

- [ ] Player moves forward/back/left/right with WASD
- [ ] Sprint works when holding Shift
- [ ] Jump works with Space (only when grounded)
- [ ] Mouse look is smooth and responsive
- [ ] Camera doesn't flip when looking up/down
- [ ] Vertical look is clamped to ±90 degrees
- [ ] Cursor is locked and hidden in Play mode
- [ ] ESC unlocks cursor
- [ ] Player collides with obstacles
- [ ] No console errors
